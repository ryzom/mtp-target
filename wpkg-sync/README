Introduction
------------

wpkg-sync is a tool intended to enable Windows programmers to quickly and
easily download, install and use commonly used precompiled libraries. for
example creating a program with ftp support the compiled CURL library and
header files may be needed, with wpkg-sync you can acquire and begin using
CURL in a matter of minutes negating the need for downloading and compiling 
the source repeatedly to make the library work with a Windows environment.

wpkg-sync is currently available from the following download sites.

    http://ace.planet-d.net/dl/wpkg-sync.zip

wpkg-sync is currently developed and tested under Windows environments. 




Installation
------------

 - Create a folder for wpkg-sync in a location of your choice recommended
   locations are:
   
	C:\wpkg-sync
	or
	C:\Program Files\wpkg-sync


 - Extract the 'wpkg-sync.zip' archive to a destination folder you have created
   using winzip or any compatible zip decompression package.




Configuration - wpkg-sync.cfg
-----------------------------

 - Enter the folder you have extracted wpkg-sync into.

 - Open wpkg-sync.cfg with notepad.

 - Locate the 'LocalRepository' variable which by default will look similar to
   this:

	LocalRepository = "";

 - Change "" to the path of your choice the path must exist and it is 
   recommended to use:

	LocalRepository = "C:\wpkg";
	or
	LocalRepository = "C:\Program Files\wpkg";



Configuration - VC++ Includes & Libraries
-----------------------------------------

 - Run Microsoft Visual C++.

 - Goto to the [Tools->Options] menu in VC++.

 - Select the 'Directories' tab.

 - In 'Include files' category, add <LocalRepository>\include

 (If you want to use the STLport library you must also add this path in
  the include directory. It must be the top first of the list:
      <LocalRepository>\include\stlport
 )

 - In 'Library files' category, add <LocalRepository>\lib

 - In 'Executable files' category, add <LocalRepository>\bin

 - Add <LocalRepository>/bin to your Windows 'PATH' Environment Variable
   (or dynamic library will not be found when executing your application
    outside the compiler)




Using wpkg-sync
---------------

 - Launch 'wpkg-sync.exe'

 - Click on the 'Update Package List' button to retrieve the libraries list from
   the server.

 - To install a library, select one or more libraries in the list and click on
   the 'Install selected packages' button.
