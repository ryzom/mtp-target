Introduction
============

This module 'mtp-target-original-data' contains all the data necessary to
generate the final NeL binary data.
It uses the same directory architecture and same filename. If you want to
find the original data for data/shape/entity_pingoo_close.shape then you'll
find it in the original_data/shape/entity_pingoo_close.max

The goal of this module is to give to us and everybody to modify and or
export again the original data with new/last NeL plugins.
